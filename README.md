# Overview

This is a simple Calculator I developed as a way to introduce myself to Kotlin. The program asks the user to choose a mathematical operator from the list provided and then requests numerical values 
relevant to the selected operator (e.g. addition will request two addends). It will then output the result of the equation you gave it and end the program. The program also has some error handling in the
form of looping various requests until it recieves an acceptable input (e.g. factorial will only accept an integer).

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA to develop this software for its internal Kotlin support and to familiarize myself with the process of learning how to use a new development environment.

# Useful Websites

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)

# Future Work

- Implement more complex equation inputs and handling.
- Implement a functioning GUI.
